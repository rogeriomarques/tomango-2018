**A strong brand identity gets you more of the type of business you want, at the price you want to charge.**

Get it right, and your marketing material, website and digital marketing strategy will all pay much bigger dividends.

Get it wrong, and you’ll always be swimming against the tide.

## How we develop your brand

When we create your brand identity, the first thing we do is listen.

We want to find out as much as we can about your business, your customers, your competitors and your goals, so we can create a comprehensive design brief.

Once the brief’s been agreed, the creativity starts.

Before we put pen to paper (and yes, often the best ideas still start that way), our design team do lots – and lots - of research, because a strong brand identity is always backed up by commercial logic.

Concepts are tested against the brief to make sure they'll work to deliver a return on your investment. Ideas are tested in different situations, so we know the brand works wherever you need to use it.

When we show you our ideas, we’ll explain the thought process in detail so you can see why we’ve come up with the concept we have.

> Because we pay attention to detail, your brand identity will work harder for longer.

We’ll also make sure you make the best first impression to your customers by rolling out your new brand across all your marketing materials, whether it’s business stationery, brochures or exhibition stands.
