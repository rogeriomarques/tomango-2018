Tomango offers social media training for small groups and individuals in the Lewes and East Sussex area.

Our social media training sessions are designed for small businesses that want to can use social media more effectively to achieve their goals.

We understand that many small businesses think they lack the time to carry out a social media strategy properly, so each training session is specifically tailored to be relevant to your organisation and the resources available to you.

First, we’ll ask you some questions to help our team understand exactly:

* What you want to want to get out of the training
* Which social networks will be most relevant to your business
* What we need to focus on to get you on the right track

Once we’ve gathered your answers and done some research, we’ll invite you to our countryside studio to conduct your training. Should it be easier for you, however, we can come to you and conduct the session at your home or place of business.
