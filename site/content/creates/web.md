** A strong web presence attracts your target visitors and turns them into your new customers.**

But it's paying attention to the detail that makes all the difference.

A well-designed website is about far more than just its visual appearance.

It must be easy to find, easy to use and work **perfectly** – on every device from desktop to mobile.

We've been designing and developing websites in Sussex for over 15 years. Our huge experience in planning, designing and building website and web applications will give you the edge over your competitors.

## How we design your website

Before we even think about writing the first line of code, we need to understand what you're trying to achieve.

What’s your website for? What do you want it to do for your business? What do people want to do when they use it?

The answers to these questions form the beginnings of your design brief, which is referred back to during the design process.

We never lose sight of the reasons for the website – that’s how we make the biggest difference to your business.
