So you've decided [you need a new website](/thinks/do-i-need-a-new-website/), settled on [the type of website you need](/thinks/what-sort-of-website-do-i-need/), and [created a website design brief](/thinks/create-website-design-brief-download-template/). You're ready to put the feelers out so you can choose a [web design](/creates/web) agency.

But how do you choose the right agency for your project?

## Comparing apples with oranges

Clients frequently tell me how confusing it is to choose between the different sized and shaped web design companies, especially when you get such a wide range of approaches and costs. After all, they're all delivering the same thing, aren't they?

Not necessarily.

Choosing the right web design agency is very much "[horses for courses](http://www.usingenglish.com/reference/idioms/horses+for+courses.html)"; different agencies suit different requirements. Here we offer our top 16 tips to help you choose the right agency for *your* web project.

## 1. Previous work

You've probably taken a look at the agency's website which in most cases will include a portfolio where you can take a look through their work. Does the agency have a broad range of design styles, and in particular does it look like they'd be capable of designing to your brief?

Be sure to dig a bit deeper. For your web project to be a success, it doesn't just need to look pretty - it needs to deliver results.

What results has the agency delivered for other clients? What do their clients have to say about them? If possible, try contacting the client direct to get a reference.

## 2. Relevant experience

Has the agency designed and built websites similar to your brief? Do they have experience of developing the sort of features or functionality you want to include? Not only will this give you peace of mind that they can deliver, but they'll also be able to offer you some insights that might improve the final site.

Has the agency worked with other clients in your industry before? This can be a double-edged sword in my opinion. On the one hand, knowledge of industry practices and terminology can be a definite advantage, and experience working with other clients with similar needs can give your project a leg up. On the other hand, if the agency has no experience of your industry, they bring a fresh perspective and don't have any pre-conceived ideas based on what they've done before.

## 3. What's their own website like?

Bit of an obvious one, this, but do you want to give your project to a web agency that can't even look after its own website properly?

Their site is their chance to show what they're made of. If it looks crap - or untouched - what does that tell you about how well organised they are?

## 4. Capability/size of team

You'll have a wide range of sizes of agencies to choose from for your project; from one-man/woman bands up to large agencies with dozens of employees. So how do you know which is right for you?

Think about what help and support you need during the project, and what ongoing service you need after. If you plan to look after the site yourself once it's built, and you're comfortable writing copy, sourcing images and putting the content onto the site in the first place, you might want to go to a one-man band. Beware though that ongoing support might be sketchy and you're probably going to have to do a lot of the work yourself.

![](images/blog/shutterstock_284519087-719x630.jpg "How big does your chosen agency need to be?")

If you need your web agency to take control of your project for you and offer expertise in different departments (strategy, copywriting, photography, to name just three), we recommend looking at small agencies of between 4-10 people.

> Bigger doesn't necessarily mean better

If you have a particularly large project that requires expertise in niche areas like UX, or the sheer volume of content needs a larger team to handle it, you might want to go to a larger agency. But be aware that you'll probably be paying a higher rate.

Ask questions about who does what, to establish whether the agency has the skills within the team to cope with your needs. Bigger doesn't necessarily mean better; some of the best agencies have teams of fewer than 10 people.

## 5. How long have they been around?

Has the agency been around for a while, or are they a start-up? If it's a well-established agency, their longevity suggests they must be doing something right.

Don't immediately write-off the newbies though. Take a closer look at the key people who'll be involved in your project; how long have they been doing what they do?

## 6. Processes and planning

If your website's very simple, you know exactly what you want, and you're not fussed about the website working all that hard for your business (and there's not necessarily anything wrong with that - your marketing effort might be better spent elsewhere), then planning and strategy aren't going to be at the top of your wishlist.

But most businesses and organisations need a website that delivers an impressive return on investment, and to maximise ROI you need a site that's well-planned by people who know what they're doing.

> Ask about how they'll approach your project

A good web agency will work with you to develop your online strategy, help you pinpoint your target audiences, develop [personas](/thinks/what-are-personas/) to improve usability of the site, and create user journeys to deliver the highest conversion rates.

![](images/blog/personas-examples.jpg "Personas bring your site's users to life")

Ask questions about their processes and how they approach projects. Are they organised, with clear scheduling and communication throughout? Do you get to talk directly to the people working on the site, or do you need to go through an account manager? Is there a collaborative design process in place, where you're involved as the design develops, and have the opportunity to give feedback?

## 7. Standards of work

It might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you're weighing up who you should choose for your website project, but don't underestimate the importance of good standards of coding and design. Will your website be W3C compliant and adhere to best practice with regards to accessibility and usability?

Definitely make sure your new site's responsive and gives users the best experience on all devices, including tablet and mobile. This goes beyond simply resizing menus and images - a well-designed responsive site considers connection speed and how our behaviour changes when we're using different devices, and adapts accordingly.

![](images/blog/browns-featured.jpg "If your new site isn't responsive - and I mean PROPERLY responsive - it's going to damage your sales")

## 8. What do you get for your money?

What do you actually get for the price of the project? Will the site be populated and ready to go live or will you need to put your content into an empty site? If the website *is* populated with your content, how much effort goes into styling it properly, or is it just an exercise in copy and paste?

> How much will you have to do?

Who writes the content? What about images/video/other stuff? How much do you, the client, have to do?

Ask yourself how much time you have to put into the project. Are you better off having the experts doing everything for you, or would you prefer to save a bit of money and do more yourself?

## 9. What are the people like?

You need to know you're going to get on with the people you're going to be working with. What impression do you get from the agency's website, the way they responded to your enquiry, your email communications?

Do they seem like your kind of people?

> Can you work with these guys?


## 10. Communication

How well does the agency communicate with you? Do they understand where you're coming from and can explain their ideas clearly, or are you left befuddled by marketing speak and jargon?

What's also important is *how* you'll communicate during the project. Will it be face-to-face, over the phone, or just by email? Sometimes things get lost in translation when you're only able to talk over the phone or by email.

![](images/blog/what-we-do-brand.jpg "Will you get to sit round a table and point at stuff?")

We know our clients really value being able to meet up to go through things like design ideas and planning sessions face-to-face. How important is it to you and your project?

## 11. Do they outsource?

Smaller agencies are less likely to do everything in-house. And if they don't, then who's actually doing the work? How much control does the agency have over that work? If they're using a freelancer and that person goes under a bus, what happens then? Or - in a more likely scenario - how do they make sure your project gets priority over the freelancer's other work?

## 12. Do they do online marketing too?

If your website needs to be found on search, you need to find out *now* what the [web design](/creates/web) agency's going to do about it, not when the project's halfway through, or nearing completion.

A successful [online marketing](/creates/online-marketing) campaign needs the website to be set up right, stuff like page names and how your copy's structured; things you'll be working out right at the start of the project. If your web agency does online marketing too, you'll get a more joined-up approach to the whole project. If they don't, how will they work with the people doing your SEO?

## 13. Do they do brand identity and offline design work?

Similarly, if you're planning to invest in a new [brand identity](/creates/brand) and other printed marketing materials to really make your project a success, get everything created by the same agency for a much more cohesive and consistent result.

![](images/blog/sussex-oak-featured1.jpg)

A good design agency that's designing your website as part of a wider rebranding project will add value to your whole marketing effort.

## 14. Budget

In the web design business, as with much in life, you really do get what you pay for.

Don't forget the difference between *cost* and *value*. If you spend £5,000 on a good website and it generates an additional £20,000 of revenue, depending on your margins, that's probably pretty good value. Spend £500 on a site that does nothing, and you've just lost 500 quid.

## 15. Timescales

So now we're getting into the more nitty gritty, practical considerations.

When can the agency start on the project, and when will it be finished? Does this fit with your deadlines?

> A good website takes time to design and build properly

Here's a couple of bits of advice to remember when comparing timescales;

1. A good website takes time to plan, design, build and test properly. Would you expect a high quality project to be turned around in a couple of weeks?
1. As the old adage goes, "if you want something done, ask a busy man." There's a good reason busy people are in high demand. It might be worth waiting for the best agency for your project



## 16. Legal stuff and payment terms

Lastly, but not leastly, be sure to find out about the legal stuff and payment terms.

What are their terms and conditions? Do you have full ownership and intellectual property rights of the final website? When do you have to pay, and how much? It's usual for an agency to ask for a deposit upfront, but find out about when other payments are due and the amounts.

## How to make initial contact

Once you've decided which web agencies you want to talk to, pick up the phone or drop them an email - depending on your preference - to make your initial contact. Not sure what to say in your email? Try something like this:

> Dear Tony,

I'm the owner of an architect practice in Brighton and we'd like to talk to Tomango about rebranding our business and developing a new website.

Is this something you’d be interested in?

Please can someone get in touch either by phone or email so that we can discuss it further.

Many thanks,

Give them your phone number *and* email address to make communication easier. Some agencies might prefer to call in the first instance, and some might prefer to email. You'll probably get one of several responses;

*No response* – Hmmm, not very polite. If they can't be bothered to reply, you probably won't want to work with them.
*A polite no* – Sometimes an agency won't be that interested in the project. Maybe it's not the type of project they really want to be doing, or they're just too busy. Don't be offended; no-one got hurt. Move on
*An email back* – If they're interested and what to find out more, they might ask you for a full [website design brief](/thinks/create-website-design-brief-download-template/) so they can give the project some thought before getting back to you with a quote.
*A phone call* – Good agencies often like to phone to have an initial chat about your project. If the phone goes the same day you send your email, you know they’re really interested.

So how quickly should you expect a reply?

I'd suggest any longer than 5 working days is too long to reply to your email, and you should assume they’re not really interested in your project. I always try to respond within 24 hours, either by phone or email, but that's just the way I roll. I like it when people get back to me quickly, so I like to do the same for our clients.

Remember, the key to your decision is seeing which of the agencies you really connect with. People like working with people they like, and when you click with your chosen design agency, magical things will happen...
