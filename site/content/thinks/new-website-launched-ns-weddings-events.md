We're delighted to announce the long-awaited launch of a [new website](/creates/web) for NS Weddings &amp; Events, [wedding and events planners](http://www.nsweddingsandevents.com) in Hampshire.

Founder Naomi Sautter and her team work closely with their clients to transform their ideas into an event that guests will talk about for years.

In addition to a First Class Honours degree in Business Management from the University of Winchester, Naomi Sautter has a Diploma in Wedding Planning from the Blackford Centre for Professional Wedding Planners. Your dream event is guaranteed to be professionally planned.

Her team of creative and passionate [wedding and event planners](http://www.nsweddingsandevents.com) create flawless, stunning weddings and events that will exceed your expectations.

We worked closely with Naomi to write the copy for the website and source stunning images from Naomi's extensive libraries.

We're very pleased with the end result, which we believe places NS Weddings &amp; Events at the forefront of its industry, and look forward to seeing everyone's hard work bearing fruit in the near future.
