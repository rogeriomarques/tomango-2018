## BC Beauty Training

[BC Beauty Training](https://bcbeautytraining.co.uk/) is an award-winning Brighton-based provider of accredited courses that cover all aspects of beauty, including hair, makeup, tanning, nails and massage.

The company was started by Maria Lloyd in 2013 who, after taking some beauty training courses that she found somewhat lacking, decided she could do it better herself!

Within five short years, she had built the business into one of the leading training centres for beauty in the South East, winning the ‘Beauty Training Academy of the Year’ accolade at the 2018 English Hair and Beauty Awards.

Maria estimates that she and her team have trained approximately 2500 people since starting out, with about 500 of those students going on to start their own beauty business. Not bad!

## Cannadines

[Cannadines](https://www.cannadines.co.uk/) is a family-run business in Uckfield that specialises in quality fitted kitchens, bathrooms and bedrooms. Founded in 1994, the company has steadily grown under the stewardship of Peter Cannadine and his son Ross, and in April 2017 moved to its current showroom location on the Bellbrook Industrial Estate. 

Tomango has worked with Cannadines since 2003; the relationship between Ross and our MD Mark started as a result of a chance encounter at an ante-natal class shortly before the birth of their children.

In that time we’ve helped them establish their dominant local online presence; they enjoy page one position one for a whole range of their key search terms.

In 2018 we launched a redeveloped website, repositioning them in their marketplace as the number one provider of quality kitchens, bathrooms and bedrooms in the area. Read more about how we’ve helped Cannadines in our [case study](created/bc-beauty-training/).

## ECE

In the spring of 2015, award-winning architects [ECE Architecture](https://www.ecearchitecture.com/) asked us to help them grow their business by attracting the best young talent available to join their team.

It was clear they needed an online presence that not only delivered more of the clients they wanted to work with, but also focused on the careers, culture and social side of life at ECE.

Since launching the site later that year, ECE has grown from 50 people to over 80, and is working on some of the most exciting projects in its history.

We’ve worked with them several times since then, implementing a number of phased developments to make sure the site continues to put them at the forefront of their industry and work hard for the business.

Read our [case study](created/ece/) for more information about what we did for ECE.

## HOP

[HOP](https://www.hop.uk.com/) is a multi-disciplinary practice of Consulting Civil, Structural & Marine Engineers at the forefront of the design of high-quality building and engineering projects.

Established in 1985 by two Civil & Structural Engineers, it has since grown to an over 60-strong, national consulting engineering practice offering expertise in the fields of structural, environmental, civil and marine engineering.

HOP came to us having seen the work we did for ECE Architecture. Their website no longer reflected their position in the marketplace and they asked us to redesign the site to put them back on top and ahead of their competitors. Find out more about the work we’ve done for HOP in our [case study](created/hop/).

## Cade Street Nursery

The Honeysett family has been growing garden plants at [Cade Street Nursery](http://cadestreetnursery.co.uk/) near Heathfield for over 50 years. From humble beginnings growing lettuces in 1968, the business has grown under the leadership of first David and then his son Rob, who joined the company in 2013 having spent 11 years working for a national retailer sourcing their plant and flower range.

The nursery now produces and sells over 250,000 individual plants a year across 800 varieties and colours.

Tomango has worked with Cade Street Nursery since 2015, initially designing a new website, before carrying out a local [digital marketing campaign](thinks/helping-cade-street-nursery-to-grow/) to increase its profile amongst its target market.

In 2019, ecommerce facilities are going to be added to the site, allowing retail customers the opportunity to buy online and either have their plants delivered to their home, or collect them from the nursery or Dulwich market which meets each Saturday morning and where Cade Street has a stall.
