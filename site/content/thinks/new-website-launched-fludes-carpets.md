We’ve recently [launched a new website](/creates/web) for one of the region’s top specialist carpet and flooring retailers that has been trading for over 80 years. [Fludes Carpets](/created/fludes-carpets/) offers quality but affordable flooring solutions for customers throughout the South of England.

Fludes’ existing website had several issues; it was outdated and not in keeping with their brand values, there was a need to review the content on the site, and thought was required as to how to display everything users might want to see in the simplest way possible.

We worked closely with Fludes to establish the key users of the site, the information they would want and need to find on the website and how best to organise and display the content in order to ensure a rewarding user experience.

Our development team has built a completely bespoke Carpet Calculator which allows users to enter a few details about their room and then calculates the amount of carpet they will need and an estimated cost. Another great feature is the store locator, developed using Google’s Map API it allows users to quickly find their nearest store.

We’re delighted to be working with Fludes on an ongoing basis as their digital agency; developing the site’s content, managing their social media and implementing their online marketing strategy.
