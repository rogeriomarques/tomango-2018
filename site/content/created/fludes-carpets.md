Fludes Carpets asked us to increase their sales of Karndean flooring. We put in place a new content strategy over six months that immediately led to a significant jump in sales.

Based on the brief, we proposed creating a more robust and informative Karndean section of the [website](/creates/web). The goal was to produce a hub of information to answer the majority of the visitorâ€™s questions about the product.
