Hartwell Insurance is an insurance company with a difference. Its founders set out with the intention of creating an insurer that works in favour of the insurance broker community and its clients - not the other way around.

Having already established itself in the US just through personal contacts, Hartwell recognised the need to have the right brand in place to reach the wider market place and properly disrupt the traditional way of doing insurance
business.

We were initially approached to help [design a website](/creates/web), but following discussions with the client they agreed with our recommendation to invest in a [brand identity](/creates/brand) which could be rolled out across all their marketing material.

Tomango created the brand identity and applied it to business stationery and a luxury quarter-fold brochure. We then designed a series of super-performant websites for each of the products and markets Hartwell wanted to focus on.
These have a striking visual style that clearly sets them apart from the plainer, run-of-the-mill insurance company websites common to the industry.

The sites are created as Progressive Web Apps, so the founders can present to prospects wherever they are, even if thereâ€™s no internet connection.
