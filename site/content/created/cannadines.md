Cannadines is a family-run business that specialises in the design, supply and installation of high-end kitchens, bathrooms and bedrooms.

In April 2017, the company made the big decision to move the business to a much bigger showroom, having been on the High Street for 25 years.

Not one to rest on their laurels, later that year we began discussions with them about how to reposition their business online. 

Now they had the right physical presence, they needed their website to reflect their brand values and tell more people in their catchment area about the “new” Cannadines.

The [new website](/creates/web), which repositions them as a premium supplier, was launched in the late summer of 2018, and they started seeing the benefits straight away.

{{< quote
	body="The effect of having a new website was immediate. In the first month after launch, our enquiries more than doubled."

Now the site’s live, we’re developing Cannadines online presence across [social media](/creates/online-marketing/social-media/) and increasing their search visibility, to attract more of their best customers and continue to grow their business.
