HOP came to us having seen the work we did for [ECE Architecture](http://www.ecearchitecture.com/). Their website no longer reflected their position in the marketplace and they asked us to redesign the site to put them back on top and ahead of their competitors.

{{< quote
	body="Our new site’s repositioned us at the top of our industry and is definitely helping us attract more of the projects we want to win."

Using the exceptional photography available – particularly of their projects – we utilised [web design](/creates/web) to create a contemporary, highly visual site that strengthens their brand and gives them the edge over their competitors in winning more of the projects they want.
